# FitMAP
Created a basic fitness workout tracker under the guidance of Jonas Schmedtmann. Adapted some stuff in code.

App allows you to switch between running and cycling. Clicking on the workout pans the map to that specific workout. You can delete all workouts (they are only saved in Local Storage).

Implemented custom alert notifications using SweetAlert2.
